## Fields
Can be
- Scalar:
	- Temperature
	- Pressure
	- density
- Vectorial:
	- Gravitational
	- Velocity
	- Force

# Electrical charge and Coulomb's law
the origin of electricity: the atom
- two polarities
	- positive
	- negative
- The total amount (net) charge in the universe is constant (pairs of positive and negative charges can be created and destroyed)
-  They are quantized, any charge Q in nature is an integer multiple of the charge of a proton

Charges are scalar, so we create charge density to define it as a vector
- Linear charge density $\lambda = \frac{dq}{d\ell}$
- Surface charge density $\sigma = \frac{dq}{dS}$
- Volumetric charge density $\rho = \frac{dq}{dV}$
## Coulomb law
For the forces ($F_{21}$ and $F_{12}$) created between two charges ($q_1$ and $q_2$) he found that
- the modulus are equal, opposed and related to the charges
- the forces modulus are related to 1/r² (r is the distance between the forces)
so the formula is
$$
F_{nm} = K\frac{q_n q_m}{R^2}\widehat{u_{nm}}
$$
given $K = 9 \cdot 10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$

you can have more than 2 charges, so you must use the superposition principle, calculating the final force for each charge by the sum of forces that each pair of charges generates on each charge

## Calculating the electric field
having a charge $q$, we want to calculate its field $\vec{E} = \lim_{x \to 0}{\vec{F} \over q'}$
1. we put another charge, $q'$ on the field
2. having two charges, we have $\vec{F}$ !!!
3. we can replace $\vec{F}$ on the formula using the Coulomb law!! then its $\vec{E} = \lim_{x \to 0}{K\frac{q q'}{r^2}\widehat{u} \over q'}$
4. we cancel $q'$ on the fraction: $\vec{E} = \lim_{x \to 0}{K\frac{q}{r^2}\widehat{u}}$

## Electric fields lines
![[Pasted image 20250912112308.png]]
positve charges -> lines out
negative charges - lines go in
- nº of lines
	- if only one charge
		- as may as you want (4)
	- if more than one
		- for each charge, nº of lines proportional charge (for a charge 2 times larger than other, half of the lines point to the other charge)

## calculating the electric field created by a volume
to calculate the electric field of a continuous distribution, $\vec{E}$ we ummm do this I guess
$$
	\vec{E}
	=
	\int d \vec E
	=
	\int_Q k {dq \over r^2} \hat u
	=
	\int_V k {\rho dv \over r^2} \hat u
$$
for a surface its something like
$$
	\vec{E}
	=
	\int d \vec E
	=
	\int_Q k {dq \over r^2} \hat u
	=
	\int_S k {\sigma dS \over r^2} \hat u
$$
note that we are replacing $dq$ for $\sigma ds$ from the $\sigma = \frac{dq}{dS}$ formula thing seen earlier

For a discrete distribution
$$
	\sum_{i=1}^n k {q_i \over r_i^2} \hat u
$$
## Electric field created by a linear distribution
idk, from 

$$
	\vec{E}
	=
	\int d \vec E
	=
	\int_Q k {dq \over r^2} \hat u
	=
	\int_L k {\rho dV \over r^2} \hat u
$$
we got to
$$
	E_x = \int dE_x = K \lambda \int_L {d\ell \over r^2}  \sin \theta
$$
$\ell = \arctan \theta$
$$
d\ell ={a 1 \over cos² \theta d\theta}
$$


---
- Discrete
  $$
    \vec E = {\sum_{i=1}^n} k {q_i \over r^2_i} \hat u_i
   $$
- Continuous
  $$
  \vec E = \int_Q k {dq \over r^2 } \hat u = \int d\vec E
  $$
# Electrical Flux
- don't confuse $\times$ with $\cdot$ !!! $\cdot$ is the scalar product

# Electric Potential

umm i dont understand hehe

$\epsilon_0$ is permitivity????

## Potential Gradient
umm i dont understand hehe

- the formulas depend of the number of the number of dimensions
	- for 1 dimensions the formula is $df = f'(x_0)dx = \frac{df}{dx}dx$
	- for 3 dimensions the formula is $df = \vec\nabla f \cdot d\ell$ given that $\vec\nabla = {\partial\over\partial x}\hat i + {\partial\over\partial y}\hat j + {\partial\over\partial z}\hat k$
- $\partial$ is the symbol for partial derivatives

### Exercice
$$
 V = 3xye^{z+y}; ¿\vec E?
$$

$$
\vec E =
-\vec \nabla V =
\left({\partial\over\partial x}\hat i + {\partial\over\partial y}\hat j + {\partial\over\partial z}\hat k\right) =

-3ye^{z+y} \hat i - (3xe^{z+y}+ 3xye^{z+y})\hat j - 3xye^{z+y}\hat k

$$
