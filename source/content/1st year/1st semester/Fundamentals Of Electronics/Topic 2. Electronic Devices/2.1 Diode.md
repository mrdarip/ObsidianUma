- **Semiconductors and Doping**
    - A semiconductor without impurities is called **intrinsic**.
    - A semiconductor doped with controlled impurities is called **extrinsic**.
    - Extrinsic semiconductors are categorized into two types:
        - **N-type:** Contains more electrons than holes. Impurities are called **donors** (e.g., Phosphorus, Arsenic, Antimony), as they provide an extra electron.
        - **P-type:** Contains more holes than electrons. Impurities are called **acceptors** (e.g., Boron, Gallium, Aluminum), as they provide a **hole**. Holes are considered carriers of positive charge.
- **The P-N Junction (Diode Structure)**
    - A diode is formed by a **P-N junction** in a semiconductor monocrystal, created by doping two zones differently (one P and one N).
    - **Depletion Zone:** This region, also called the transition or space charge zone, is near the metallurgical junction. Due to carrier diffusion, this zone is left charged but essentially **without carriers**.
    - A **potential of contact ($\Phi_T$)** establishes itself in the junction to oppose further diffusion, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between diffusion current and drift current (of thermal origin).
- **Diode Polarization (Biasing)**
    - **Null Polarization ($V_D = 0$):** No current flows, maintaining dynamic equilibrium. The tension in the junction is the potential of contact ($\Phi_T$).
    - **Forward Bias (ON Bias, $V_D > 0$):** The potential applied reduces the tension in the junction. The diffusion phenomenon prevails, leading to a **large current** that increases exponentially with voltage.
    - **Reverse Bias (OFF Bias, $V_D < 0$):** The potential applied increases the tension in the junction. Diffusion virtually disappears, and the resulting current is a **small, negative, constant current** called the **inverse saturation current ($I_S$)**.
- **Characteristic Curve and Simplified Models**
    - The diode characteristic curve (intensity vs. tension) is **non-linear**.
    - The mathematical relationship is given by the **Diode Law**: $I_D = I_S(e^{(q V_D / k T)}-1)$.
    - For simplicity and practical analysis, the non-linear characteristic is approximated using **linearized models**. The main models are:
        1. **Idealized Model:** Treats the diode as a **short circuit** in forward bias ($V_D = 0$) and an **open circuit** in reverse bias ($I_D = 0$).
        2. **Model with Umbral Tension ($V_{Don}$):** Accounts for the required threshold voltage for conduction. In forward bias, $V_D = V_{Don}$ when $I_D \ge 0$, and in reverse bias, $I_D = 0$ when $V_D \le V_{Don}$.
        3. **General Linearized Model:** Adds a **series resistance ($R_D$)** in forward bias to account for resistive voltage drop, along with the umbral tension $V_{Don}$.
- **Other Diode Types**
    - The **Zener diode** is designed to operate in the **inverse rupture zone**.
    - It conducts intensely starting at a specific inverse polarization voltage, called the **rupture voltage ($V_Z$)**.
    - Other types include **diodes varactors** (voltage-controlled capacitors), **light-emitting diodes (LEDs)**, **photodiodes**, and **Schottky diodes**.
