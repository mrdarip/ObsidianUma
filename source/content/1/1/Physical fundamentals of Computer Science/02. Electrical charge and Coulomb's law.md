the origin of electricity: the atom
- two polarities
	- positive
	- negative
- The total amount (net) charge in the universe is constant (pairs of positive and negative charges can be created and destroyed)
-  They are quantized, any charge Q in nature is an integer multiple of the charge of a proton

Charges are scalar, so we create charge density to define it as a vector
- Linear charge density $\lambda = \frac{dq}{d\ell}$
- Surface charge density $\sigma = \frac{dq}{dS}$
- Volumetric charge density $\rho = \frac{dq}{dV}$
## Coulomb law
For the forces ($F_{21}$ and $F_{12}$) created between two charges ($q_1$ and $q_2$) he found that
- the modulus are equal, opposed and related to the charges
- the forces modulus are related to 1/rÂ² (r is the distance between the forces)
so the formula is
$$F_{nm} = K\frac{q_n q_m}{R^2}\widehat{u_{nm}}$$
given $K = 9 \cdot 10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$

you can have more than 2 charges, so you must use the superposition principle, calculating the final force for each charge by the sum of forces that each pair of charges generates on each charge
